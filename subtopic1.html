<tr><td><b>Abstract:</b>
This article describes the evolution of animation beginning with traditional cel painting techniques and moving into modern digital workflows. It explains how animators originally painted every frame by hand and how tools like Xerox transfer and computer-assisted processes later reduced labor and increased precision. It details how digital ink-and-paint systems, such as Disney’s CAPS, transformed production by enabling enhanced color control, layering, and complex camera movements that were not possible with physical cels. This shift allowed studios to create more dynamic films and sped up production dramatically.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Abstract:</b>
This source outlines animation’s technological journey from early optical devices to cel animation and ultimately to digital systems. It highlights inventions like the multiplane camera that created depth in early films and explains how computers replaced physical painting and layering with digital workflows. The article emphasizes how digital tools increased creative freedom by allowing easier corrections, more complex effects, and streamlined production pipelines. It shows how the shift from analog to digital fundamentally changed animation’s efficiency and artistic potential.</td></tr>
